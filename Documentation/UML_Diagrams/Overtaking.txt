Overtaking State Diagram
Unlike many state diagrams, the car is not actually inactive during the idle state. Until the overtaking request is sent, the overtaking behaviour is active and listening for a request just like the other behaviours. Normally, the car will be engaged in the lane following process at this time. The overtaking process is first activated when the sensors detect an obstacle ahead of the car in the lane. Once the distance to that obstacle is measured, and the car as approached it to a certain distance, the car will start overtaking the obstacle. Once the sensors have detected that the obstacle is no longer in the way on the right hand side of the vehicle (overtaken), the car will turn back into its lane and return to the original position and continue lane following. Because the car returns to the lane following process after the overtaking is completed, the overtaking process can also start from the beginning and wait for a new obstacle, making it an infinite loop.
