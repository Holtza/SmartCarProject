Parking State

The start point of the car is it's idle, off state. Once the car is started it changes into it's moving state. The car receives sensor data from the sensors on a time-period basis and changes state or remains in moving state depending on the data received. If an object is detected the car remains in a solely moving state, on the other hand if free space is detected, it will change into the calculate space state. Once the calculation is complete, it'll decide if the space is sufficient or insufficent, depending on the outcome it will either return in the moving state (insufficent space found) or in the stop car state (sufficient space found). The stop car state is not immidiately stopping the car as the name suggests, instead it moves the car forward until there is sufficient space for the car to perform a backwards maneuver and then stops the car. Afterwards the car enters the event of parking which will change the the state into the backwards maneuver state. The backwards manuever state does a backwards maneuver which parks the car in the free space between the two objects, stops it complete, and sends an event that the car is parked which terminates the process.
