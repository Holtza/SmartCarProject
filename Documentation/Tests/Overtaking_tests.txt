Overtaking tests
The first test case we want to evaluate is when the normal overtaking circumstances are met. This situation arises when the overtaking behaviour is called with only one obstacle ahead with a clear lane to the left of the obstacle. In order to pass the test, the car needs enter the following states without any of the sensors reading obstacles closer than 2 centimeters (which we are interpreting as a collision) or stopping:  idle, estimatingObstacleDistance, passing, and moving. The simulation will be using a straight road, with a single obstacle in the same lane as the car with similar size to the car. To be in the idle state, the car should be in lane following mode. It will change states when the front sensor finds an obstacle. After that, it needs to turn into the left lane and continue following the lane normally while reading the values of the right IR sensors. When the back right IR sensor sees no more obstacles, the war will turn back into the right lane and continue using the lane following process.

The second test case is for when there is an obstacle in the way in front of the initial obstacle. The test is passed if the car manages to go into lane following mode after passing the secondary obstacle without colliding with either obstacle. The simulation will use a straight road with two separate obstacles in same lane as the car. The second obstacle will be smaller than the first. The second obstacle might not be picked up at all by the IR sensors at first, or might have different readings from the main obstacle. The car needs to behave normally when overtaking while the right facing IR sensors read a short distance. (Meaning there is still an obstacle there.) The car will only behave differently once the initial obstacle has been passed. If the secondary obstacle is not seen by the sensors at all, the car will move into the passed state, then instantly go back into passing when it senses the obstacle. When the sensors pick up the secondary obstacle, it should continue going straight along the lane until the second obstacle is passed as well. If the second obstacle is detected right away after the first one is passed, the car should not exit its passing state until the second one is passed as well.

Finally, we need a test case for when there is an obstacle in a curve. The test is passed if the car stays in the idle state for the entirety of the curve and doesnâ€™t collide with any obstacles. The car then continues with the other states after the road continues in a straight line. The simulation will contain a curved road followed by straight road. The road will turn 90 degrees with a 50 centimeter radius.
