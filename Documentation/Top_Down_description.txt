Top-down car
There are two ultrasonic sensors in the front of the car, two infrared sensors on the right side of the car, and one on the back. Furthermore there is a camera looking forward giving a large view in front of the car. The infrared sensor on the back will primarily be used for the parking behaviour. It will keep track of when the car should stop when backing into the parking spot. The camera will be used primarily for the lane following process. The images recorded by the camera will be run through filters and analyzed to determine how the car should behave. The rest of the sensors will be used for both the overtaking and the parking behaviours. The side sensors will be used to determine when the car is finished overtaking as well as determining when there is an open parking spot.
